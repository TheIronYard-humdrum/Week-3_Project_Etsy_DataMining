We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):\r\n\r\n\u2022 As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.\r\n\u2022 In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung\/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung\/cork. \r\n\u2022 To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \r\n\u2022 Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.\r\n\u2022 Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \r\n\u2022 Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. \r\n\u2022 As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. \r\n\u2022 You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \r\n\u2022 Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. \r\n\u2022 If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \r\n\u2022 For your safety, if using chemicals to clean\/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for proper use.\r\n\u2022 The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!\r\n\r\nAngel\u2019s Share.\r\nAngel\u2019s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher \u201cangel\u2019s share\u201d, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;\r\n\r\nStoring your Empty Barrel After Initial Use \r\nIdeally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55\u00b0 \u2013 60\u00b0) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers\u2019 guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. \r\n\r\n","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1446905693,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":true,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SummitEngravingLtd?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/9052662\/iusb_760x100.14372376_mdth.jpg","num_favorers":951,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/130\/0\/9052662\/isla_fullxfull.19916459_jsp3bgzk.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":265393506,"state":"active","user_id":61729553,"category_id":68892062,"title":"Whiskey Label Customizable Text Wedding 200, 375 & 750ML Bottle Stickers Personalized Cold Feet Serum Label gift for Groom","description":"These unique labels are totally customizable.\n\nAt the checkout (Note to Seller) provide us the necessary information such as:\n\n\n1-Bride and Groom&#39;s names\n2-Date and Place\n3-Your phone number \n\n\nQuantity: 1 piece.

The largest forests are in Kyrgyzstan, where trees occur in extensive, nearly pure walnut forests at 1,000\u20132,000 m altitude.

"description": "Beautiful wedding garter set made with clear glass crystal rhinestones in silver settings, ivory or white elastic stretch lace, satin bow and pearls in the center. The keepsake garter has a large rhinestone decoration that measures 2 1/2&quot; x 6&quot;. The toss garter has a satin bow and a pearl decoration. Choose your lace color, size, and bow color at checkout. If you select ivory lace you will receive ivory pearls and white lace will come with white pearls. If you want ivory pearls with white lace or vice versa, just let me know in the message to seller at checkout. \n\nHow To Measure for your size:\n\nUse a soft tape measure or a string and a ruler and measure 4-5&quot; above the top of your knee below the large back leg muscle. Measure a bit snug around your leg, not too tight or too loose and measure standing up. I will make adjustments for the stretch so please do not take off any inches. Your garters will stretch to fit. You may want to purchase fashion tape to secure your garter but it may not be necessary.\n\n******************************\n\nYour garter set will come in a white gift box for safe keeping before and after your special day.\n\nMore lovely crystal garters:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/LoveForeverBridal?section_id=13306090&ref=shopsection_leftnav_2&view_type=gallery\n\n\nThank you for visiting Love Forever Bridal Boutique!",

For details, see individual items.\n\nESTIMATED SHIPPING TIME\nNorth America: 3 - 5 business days\n\nI'll do my best to meet these shipping estimates, but cannot guarantee them. Actual delivery time will depend on the shipping method you choose.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES FEES\nBuyers are responsible for any customs or duties fees that may apply. Sellers aren't responsible for delays due to customs",

"policy_additional": "I will only use your shipping and billing address, and contact information\n- To communicate with you about your order\n- To fulfill your order\n- For legal reasons (like paying taxes)\n\nWHAT SIZE GARTER SHOULD I ORDER?\nMeasure with a soft tape measure or a string and a ruler where you would like to wear your keepsake garter. Order your exact size and I will take of inches to account for the stretch. Your toss garter will be a bit smaller. Due to body type variations and other factors fashion tape may be needed to secure your keepsake garter in place. If you are ordering a single toss garter, measure where you would like to wear it. If you are ordering as a gift you will have to make your best guess. People of the same weight and height can have a different thigh measurement.\n\nHOW LONG UNTIL MY ORDER SHIPS?\nYour order will be sent out on the 4th or 5th business day after you place your order. Business days do not include Saturday, Sunday or any US holidays. Once your order ships, it will be delivered 2-5 days later. For shipping plus processing, allow up to 2 weeks to receive your order in the USA.\n\nOrders to Canada are usually delivered 2-3 weeks after your order date. Other international orders usually arrive in 3 weeks but can take up to 4 weeks.\n\nI NEED MY ORDER SOONER THAN 2 WEEKS, CAN I GET IT SOONER?\nIf you are in the USA you may place a rush order by following the instructions below:\n\nSince I custom hand make each item after it is ordered, it is very difficult to rush all orders that are needed sooner. For this reason, I have a rush order fee. Go to the top of my shop and click on rush orders. Read ALL the rush order info and select either one week rush or less than a week rush from the drop down box and click add to cart. Then, go back and add your item(s) to your cart and checkout. The expected delivery times are stated under the photo in the rush fee listing.\n\nSASHES: WHAT DOES RHINESTONE LENGTH MEAN?\nRhinestone length is the number of inches total the rhinestones will be, so for example, if you order a 13 1/2&quot; sash and have a 28&quot; waist, the rhinestone portion will go about 1/2 way around your waist and the rest of the way will be satin ribbon. Sash centerpieces are always the same size regardless of rhinestone length. Wherever the rhinestones end it looks intentional and then the bow will tie in the back. I recommend a minimum of 1/2 your waist measurement. Do not worry if you want the sash all the way to the back and that particular sash does not have your exact size. Order the closest size and then there will be room to tie the bow. If you need help choosing a rhinestone length let me know and I am happy to help you! :)\n\nSASHES: CAN I ORDER WITH NO RIBBON OR A CLASP?\nYou can select no ribbon from the drop down box, or, if there is no option for no ribbon, write me a note in the message to seller at checkout. If you order without ribbon, you will need a seamstress to sew your sash to your dress. If you would like a clasp you should order with no ribbon and have your seamstress add a clasp. Sashes can vary by up to 1/2&quot; so it is better to have the seamstress measure you in person and then add the clasp, making sure the sash will fit properly. If you want a clasp added, you may want to order 1&quot; larger so the seamstress can cut it down if needed.\n\nI ONLY WANT ONE GARTER FROM THIS SET, CAN I ORDER JUST THE ONE?\nYes I sell garters separately. Check the single garters section by clicking &quot;single garters&quot; on the top left above. If the garter you want is not in that section just send me a message letting me know what you want and I will tell you how to order.\n\nCAN YOU MAKE THIS WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR RIBBON?\nI have 35 satin colors to choose from but if there is another color you would like contact me to discuss it. Usually the cheapest (for you) and easiest way is for me to tell you the ribbon width you need and then you can find the color you want online, purchase it and have it sent to me to make your item and I will send you the excess ribbon with your order.\n\nCAN I BUY THIS AND RETURN IT IF IT DOESN&#39;T WORK?\nSorry all sales are final. Each item is custom hand made to order in your size and colors. If there was some mistake or defect (rare) I will exchange it only for what was originally ordered. Since all sales are final, you can order satin swatches in my shop to see the ribbon color before you order. You can also request to order rhinestones, pieces of sashes etc...",

"description": "**Please** check our policies page here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/riskybeads/policy\nfor current turnaround times, holiday deadlines, rush order and shipping options, etc. Thank you!\nWe recommend Priority Mail for all USA customers. First Class is taking too long.\nPersonalization details go in the blank white box in your cart.\nPlease take your time placing your order, double check personalization and ship to address.\n¨¨¨¨°º©©º°¨¨¨¨¨¨°º©©º°¨¨¨¨¨¨°º©©º°¨¨¨¨¨¨°°º©©º°¨¨¨¨¨¨°º©©º°¨¨¨¨¨¨\nSometimes the loss of a pet can be made just a little easier with a keepsake.  I designed this ornament for my sister after the loss of her yellow lab. Each ornament is hand stamped, letter by letter, on a 1.5&quot; nickel silver disc with a red or green string for hanging on the tree. This particular design has a dog stamp, #104, in the middle with &#39;IN LOVING MEMORY&#39; stamped beneath it. Along the edge of the disc is the dog&#39;s name and years lived. I can fit about 47 characters around the edge using the smallest font pictured. \n\nORDER EARLY as I got sold a ton of these last year and had to turn some folks away! \n\nView other ornaments including bulk listings for them here:\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/riskybeads?section_id=5583753\n\n⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄\nIf you need 48-57 characters instead, please order the LARGE ornament thru this listing:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/158292198/large-personalized-silver-christmas\n57 characters which includes dots around edge is the most I can fit on an ornament.\n⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ ★ ⛄ \n\nWhen you order, I need to know:\n\n1. What symbol and text you want in the middle.  Dog is #104 and cat is #103. The paw print stamp I have does NOT show up well on nickel silver because it&#39;s such a hard metal.\n2. What name(s) or wording you want around the edges\n\nPersonalization details go in the blank white box in your cart.\n\n***** PLEASE NOTE *****\nThis piece is created by hand using a hammer and metal letter and symbol stamps. Metal stamping is a quirky process - letters and symbols will never be completely straight or centered, darkening may be a bit uneven due to varying stamp depth, and stray marks may occur. These are not defects in your piece; they are what makes it unique and one of a kind. :)\n\nSee more memorial items here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/riskybeads/search?search_query=memorial\n\nSee more pet items here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/riskybeads?section_id=7869516\n\nTo add a charm, please see this listing:\nhttp://www.etsy.com/listing/77522580/add-a-charm-to-my-design-purchase-with\n\nView the rest of my shop here:\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/riskybeads\n\nOrnaments/key chains/bookmarks/zipper pulls are the perfect thoughtful gift for a teacher, babysitter, nanny, or just about anyone else on your list!

"policy_additional": "I will only use your shipping and billing address, and contact information\n- To communicate with you about your order\n- To fulfill your order\n- For legal reasons (like paying taxes)\n\nWHAT IS YOUR PROCESS (AKA WHAT IS HAND STAMPING)?\nWe make each piece one-at-a-time using a process called &#39;hand stamping.&#39; Every letter, number, and symbol you see on our pieces is hand stamped using steel font sets and symbols in set sizes and a hammer. Hand stamping forms a much deeper impression than engraving and due to hammering each letter, alignment will not be perfect. These factors contribute to the uniqueness of each piece we make.\n\nHOW WILL MY ORDER BE PACKAGED?\nAll of our pieces are packaged for gift giving the moment you receive them. They come in a fabric back, typically with our logo, that doubles as a gift bag.\n\nWILL YOU SEND A GIFT ON MY BEHALF?\nSure! We&#39;d love to. Please put the giftee&#39;s address in the &#39;ship to&#39; box when checking out and let us know who to say it&#39;s from. Please keep the note short so we can fit it on a business card sized gift card.\n\nWHERE DO I ADD PERSONALIZED INFO WHEN I ORDER?\nAll personalized info goes in the blank white box in your cart. Some items have drop down menus as well that allow you to make certain choices.\n\nDO YOU ACCEPT WHOLESALE OR BULK ORDERS?\nWe do a ton of bulk orders! Many of our listings have bulk pricing built in, but if it isn&#39;t there, feel free to ask. We can handle orders of any size. \n\nWe are not accepting new wholesale or consignment accounts at this time.\n\nCAN YOU STAMP THE BACKSIDE OF THE METAL?\nSometimes. We can backside on certain types of aluminum keychains only, and if backside wording is permitted, then the listing will say so *and* will specify how many characters are allowed on the back. We cannot stamp the back of non-aluminum pieces. \n\nBecause hand stamping is done by hammering letters/symbols into the metal, impressions are left on the reverse side.  This means that we can only permit backside stamping when we&#39;re able to hide those impressions. This also means that the backside wording needs to be shorter than the front side wording.\n\nDO YOU ACCEPT RUSH ORDERS?\nUsually, yes. We have a standard production time (typically 1-2 weeks which varies depending on time of year), and when we&#39;re not completely busy, we allow rush orders for an additional fee. A rush order ships out in 2 **business** days vs. our standard production time. Rush orders are available in your cart. \n\nPlease note that none of our rush options offer overnight delivery.\n\nARE YOUR ITEMS ALREADY MADE?\nWe typically hand stamp each order as it comes in because much of our work is custom or personalized.  *Sometimes* we may have a certain design in stock, but this is not the rule.\n\nWHAT COUNTRIES DO YOU SHIP TO?\nAs of 6/25/16, we are no longer shipping to some countries due to lost packages or postal strikes (Canada). Once Canada resolves their postal issues, we will add them back to the list. We currently ship to the following countries: Australia, Bahamas, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, China, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Guam, Jamaica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Norway, Philipines, Portugal, Puerto Rica, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Thailand,The Netherlands, United Kingdom, USA, and the US Virgin Islands.",

If for any reason you are missing something from your order or there are any questions please message us right away.   Discrepancies need to be addressed within 24 hours of the receipt of your package.\r\n\r\nCOLORS- I have done my best to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown on t he Site. However, because the colors you see will depend on your monitor, I cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display of any color will be accurate. \r\n\r\nFLAWS - Small flaws occur sometimes in fabric weaving and printing.  We do our best to examine fabric when it is purchased and when it is shipped.  Returns for small flaws are not accepted.",

I am closed weekends and all major holidays (though I do watch my messages in case you need something or have a question).\n\nIf you want to make a change to your order please request a custom order.\n\nEverything under 16 oz ships 1st class mail.  Everything above 16 oz ships priority mail depending on the situation.\n\nFirst Class Mail does not include insurance, but does include tracking.  Priority Mail does include a limited amount of insurance and tracking.  I&#39;m not responsible if USPS looses a package that is uninsured.  If you want to insure a package I will need to prepare a custom order for you.  Please contact me BEFORE you place your order.\n\nConvo me if you have any questions about shipping or charges BEFORE you place an order.  There are no shipping refunds.\n\nInternational Shipping is not available at this time.  I will ship to Canada if you request a custom order so that I can adjust the shipping correctly.\n\nNote:\nI cannot ship to an address different than that listed on the PayPal Ship to Transaction.",
"policy_refunds": "If there is a problem with your order please let us know right away.  In most cases we can correct any issues very quickly. Discrepancies need to be reported within 24 hours (one day) of the receipt of an item shipped.   In the event of a refund, you will be refunded the amount of your product less all shipping fees upon receipt / return of items.  Buyer pays return shipping.\r\n\r\nFabric cannot usually be returned as it it cut to order and considered a custom order.\r\n  \r\nChristmas items are not returnable as they are made to order and considered a custom order.\r\n\r\nPostage is automatically figured by the system.   We do not offer refunds for unused postage at this time.  Custom Orders for over 1-1/2 yards can be requested at any time to adjust shipping rates.\r\n\r\nIf you are buying a lot of fabric (over 2 yards) you might consider a custom order.   It is common that the system  may figure more shipping than is needed for larger amounts of fabric and most likely the order needs to ship Priority Mail.\r\n\r\nConvo me if you have any questions.",

"description": "Note, this is a fairly simple pattern, so it is recommended for beginner to advanced cross stitchers.\n\nPattern is for personal use, and not to be sold or distributed to anyone other than the buyer. The finished cross stitch is yours to keep, sell, or give away as you please.\n\nPattern measures 121 wide x 90 tall (boxes). 18 different DMC colors are used to complete this project. I recommend using at least 14 count aida fabric, which would be approximately 8 5/8ths x 6 3/8ths inches.\n\nThis is the pattern only. You are purchasing an 8 page, color PDF digital download that includes the photo of the project, the symbols matched with colors (all DMC colors), and the pattern itself. This can be stitched on any color aida of your choosing.",
