#### Week 3 - Project - Etsy Page - Populate Imitation Etsy Page from JSON data

##### javaScript Tools
  * Import using `import {originalItems} from './items.js'` to import only specified variable from file - _curly braces_
  * Import using ```import $ from 'jquery' ``` for entire file - _no curly braces_
  * Used `.map()` to pull desired data from original source and gather each set of data into individual **objects** - easier to manage later.
  * Use ```'\x' ``` to **insert special character**

##### CSS Tools
  * Don't be afraid to create classes.  The less we stack our CSS selectors the better.

##### jQuery Tools
  * Controlled the number of imgs on page by capping the population loop.
  * Added extra images to a _spilover_ array so I could access them later to populate on a button click.
    *  **Bug Encountered** - Couldn't figure out how to unpopulate the spilover after click.
